print("Two dozen is: ", amount)

amount = 7 * 4
print("forty-two is: ", amount)
# The fixed output would be
amount = 7 * 4
print("twenty-eight is: ", amount)
# or
amount = 7 * 6
print("forty-two is: ", amount)
# Modify 3:
amount = 8
amount += 1
print("The amount is: ", amount)
# Modify 4:
amount = 8
amount *= 2
print(amount)
# amount = amount * 2 is taking the value of amount and multiplying it by two, in this case doubling the value
